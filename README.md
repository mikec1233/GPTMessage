# GPTMessage

After OpenAI released their official ChatGPT phone application I realized I wanted a slower, more inconvenient, and  more expensive way to access the model without having to use a browser! This project connects the OpenAI API and Twilio API so that I can simply converse with the model through text messages. The application will be hosted on AWS.

I'm using this as a way to gain familiarity with python, get some more practice using API's, but mainly to practice deploying on AWS
